# Uncut Stones

What do you think about rocks and stones in the bible? Among countless references to stones in the Bible, a few stand out to me:

 - [Moses stated in Deuteronomy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2027%3A5%2D7&version=NASB):
When Moses' people build altars to God, celebrating their victories, the altars should be from uncut stones.
 - [God instructed in Exodus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2017%3A5%2D7&version=NASB):
Strike the rock, and I will give water to the people.
 - [Jesus told a parable in Matthew](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A24-27&version=NASB):
Build your house, meaning your faith and beliefs, on solid foundations.
 - [Jesus called to Peter in Matthew](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016%3A17%2D19&version=NASB):
You are the rock on which I will build my church.

What does it all mean? Well, I have a few thoughts on it. In short, God wants uncut rocks.

## Altars

### Digging in

When we go back to Deuteronomy, Moses says:

> ...as I am commanding you today, and you shall coat them with lime.
> Moreover, you shall build there an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones;
> you shall not wield an iron tool on them.
> You shall build the altar of the Lord your God of uncut stones, and you shall offer on it burnt offerings to the Lord your God

Moses had just come down from the mountain after receiving and writing the law, and saw Israel worshipping an idol against God's commandments. He feared God's wrath, so he fasted 40 days, praying earnestly for the people and specifically for Aaron, his brother. Moses understood the cost of sin, which is death, [a fate Aaron, Moses' brother, would shortly afterward face](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+10%3A6-9&version=NASB) because of his disobedience.

So Moses continued to bear witness to the things God had taught him on the mountain. In Deuteronomy 5, we read the 10 commandments, which were written by God on stone tablets and given to Moses. Even people outside of Judaism and Christianity probably know most of the commandments. In Deuteronomy 6:4-7 and Deuteronomy 10:12-22, Moses gives a law summary, which is also quoted by Jesus, and summarized here:

> Love God with everything you are.

and

> You were once strangers in a strange land and God loved and took care of you, so show the love God showed you to the strangers you meet.

While there are full books dedicated to the reading and understanding of the law God gave Moses, these two summaries are everything you need. This is the law.

The law that God has shown us is important, just as important as it was to Israel in the wilderness.

So back to the altars, Deuteronomy 27 says that immediately after crossing the Jordan river, find large stones and coat them with lime, and write the law on them. In my original reading, I had some mixed interpretations on what was going on. What's significant about the large stones? Why do the stones get a lime coating? Which law is Moses talking about?

I've settled on some details that to me make the most sense, so I'll answer my own questions.

**Were the large stones part of the altars?** No, but I think they were intended to be near each other. When this scripture talks about large stones, I think these were large boulders, large enough to be land markings. The intention is so when Israel gathered after crossing the Jordan, they could read the law, and reflect on it while worshipping God. It was also so other people crossing the Jordan river could see and read the law if they knew the language it was written in. Perhaps it was mostly intended for Egyptians that could have been following the Israelites as they left Egypt, maybe some curious about the God who caused the plagues and empowered Moses to lead the Israelites out. There is also another component, God said He would go ahead of the Israelites and prepare all the things they needed, including the boulders to write the law on.

**Why do the stones get a lime coating?** I think there is a practical and spiritual meaning here, and I can talk about both. Practically speaking, lime coating a rock is like painting primer on a wall; it helps whatever you put on the rock stay there. So when the Israelites wrote the law on the lime coating after it was set on the rock, the words of the law would adhere to the rock better, and it also helps preserve it. In fact, in Egypt, this was a common technique for drawing hieroglyphics on walls. Spiritually speaking, I could write a full blog post on this, but all things relating creation to God need a covering. Going all the way back to [Genesis 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&version=NASB), we can read that eating the fruit of the tree would cause Adam and Eve's eyes to be opened. Further more, after eating the fruit, Adam and Eve understood that they had to cover themselves in the presence of God, first by hiding, then by wearing the covering garments that God crafted for them. When we read anywhere that God requires a covering over something or someone, we should instantly understand that we are dealing with God's Holiness. In God's presence, we will always need a covering. While there has always been different physical coverings humans have used in the past, we know our ever-lasting covering is Jesus Christ, son of God.

**Which law is Moses talking about?** Here's a quote from the New American Standard Bible for [Deuteronomy 27:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+27%3A8&version=NASB):

> You shall write on the stones all the words of this Law very clearly.

Originally I wasn't sure if this was _the Law_ or just the instructions for the curses and blessings, but immediately going to the Hebrew, this is tôrâ, _the Law_. This could be a summary, like the 10 commandments, the even more brief versions in chapter 6 and 10, or maybe a much larger and expanded version. Either way, it is the full Law, as taught to Moses by God on the mountain.

### Putting it all together

There are so many pieces that I haven't unpacked, but I want to stick with what's special about the uncut-stone altars, the lime covered law stones, and what it means today.

So what about uncut stone altars? We know the boulders may be representations of us, but we can also apply the same to the uncut stones. God says ["Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+1%3A4-5&version=NASB); While not all of us are destined to be prophets, God has gone before the world and prepared us as uncut stones to build His altar for His Glory. The instructions were that the people could not use tools on the rocks, they must be used as they were provided by God. In the same sense, we should be individually uncut - there is no change that we can make to ourselves to make us fit together better or be more appealing. Furthermore, we are a community, and we all fit together. [Ephesians 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4&version=NASB) reads that while some are called to be teachers, some evangelists, and some other things, we are all meant to work in unison and unity, being the uncut stones that God prepared. We are stacked and fit together for God's glory. Now recall the instructions about the altars, they are for sacrifices, peace offerings, meals, and worship. If altars represent closeness to God, since the sacrifices and peace offerings provided a covering, naturally the meals and worship represent being close and in relationship with God. Being in relationship with God is not a new teaching that Jesus gave, it roots all the way back to Genesis; there were no barriers to us communing with God, not even clothing. The law, altars and ceremonies have always been temporary, revealing that we have lost the intimate communion humanity once had with God. They are all about protecting people in a way that they could come before God once more, even if it was temporary.

In terms of the law, there is a huge thread through the Bible, up to and past Jesus' teachings; [know the law, and write it on your heart](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+31%3A33&version=NASB). This is echoed countless times in various ways, and here's a small sampling of that list: [1 Samuel 16:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+16%3A7&version=NASB), [Psalms 37:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+37%3A31&version=NASB), [Psalms 119:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119%3A11&version=NASB), [2 Corinthians 3:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A1-3&version=NASB), [Romans 2:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A14-16&version=NASB). Even further, Jesus' teachers in [Matthew 12:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A34&version=NASB) that the heart drives the words, and we can see by extension, the actions of a person. The law isn't meant to be a rule book that we can use to judge people, it is meant for us to understand it so deeply in ourselves that we have no choice but to act on it with our words and deeds. Knowing and being able to repeat the law is on its own worthless. When we read about the large boulders to have the law written on them, the stones are our hearts, the lime coating is Christ, and the words of the law are written on, and fulfilled by, Jesus Christ. Understand this, no man, woman, or child can change their hearts outside of the renewing and transforming power of Christ.

"But Alex," you say, "I know many good people who have never been transformed, but do good things." What is a good thing? Giving to the poor? Picking up a friend who has fallen? No, that is kindness. The good I'm talking about here is spreading the gospel. Do you know what that means? It means that every single person who has not encountered and accepted Jesus Christ as their savior from sin has the eternal destination of hell. The only truly good thing we can do, as far as I can tell, is point people towards Christ. **The gospel is this: We were doomed and bound by sin and the law, from the very first sin of the very first people until Jesus Christ came. The law shows us we are sinful, and the penalty of sin is death. Jesus' life was pure and sinless, and He offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice to provide a covering for us for God's Holiness and Righteousness. Jesus' death was not the end - He rose again after three days, unbound by death and hell. Tell God you want Jesus as your savior and covering, because He is the only path to salvation. In doing this, you enter into covenant with God through Jesus, His Son, and you will now participant in His kingdom.** Jesus will be your lime covering, and He will be written on your heart, and you will follow Him.
