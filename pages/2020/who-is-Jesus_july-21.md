In John 1:45-51, Philip brings Nathanael to meet Jesus, and an interesting exchange occurs.

Philip finds and tells Nathanael:

> We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law, and also the Prophets write - Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

Nathanael replied, perhaps in jest:

> Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?

Now we've been introduced to Jesus.
The Law, the rules for holiness, have always pointed to a savior.
There is no _if you've broken the law_, only _when you broke the law_.
Read the law for yourself;
Check out the "Coles Notes" version, [the 10 commandments](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+5%3A6-21&version=NASB).
The Prophets proclaimed the Law, and pointed to a savior.
If we know nothing else, we know Jesus is some serious business.

I can't find much about Nazareth, from either the Bible or world history, but it's clear that Nathanael didn't have a good opinion about it.
The first read through, I thought about Philip exclaiming it, *We found Him!*, but what if it was more like _We found Him?_
What if no one quite got it yet?

Philip understood that Moses and the prophets talked about the Messiah, Christ, but I don't think they got it.
Why would Philip even mention Nazareth if it had a bad reputation?

I think at this point, they wanted to show up to the spectacle.
I'm sure they wanted to see a man out of his mind, claiming to be Christ, and see where the show would take them.

I'm led further to this conclusion because after Nathanael mocked Nazareth and the possibility of finding Christ, Philip said:

> Come and see.

But Jesus saw through this.
When Nathanael came to see the show, Jesus welcomes them, saying:

> Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!

Jesus understood their skepticism.
How many had come and gone before Jesus' appearance, claiming to be Christ?
How many times have the people of Israel come against the false Christs, and stoned them?
Philip and Nathanael didn't know who they were walking back to.

But Jesus said, there is no deceit in Nathanael.
Jesus didn't see the flesh, He saw the heart.
Jesus was acknowledging that, yes, Nazareth should be a surprise.
It's okay to be skeptical of His appearance.
It's okay to be skeptical of His parenthood.
Nathanael was bold in opinion, and spoke his mind.

And that's not the end of it.
Nathanael didn't understand Jesus' quip.
Nathanael, taken off guard, asked:

> How do You know me?

Jesus responded with:

> Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.

We don't know much about Nathanael.
But finally, Nathanael got it.
The fact that Jesus physically saw him means nothing, but the figs meant everything.
We've seen figs in the Bible a lot.
[Figs were a covering](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+3%3A7&version=NASB) for Adam and Eve.
The condition of fig trees were a symbol of [Israel's troubled times](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+9%3A10&version=NASB), and [Israel's prosperity](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings+4%3A25&version=NASB).
Much like how the fruit falls underneath its tree, so was Nathanael under the thriving fig tree, the fruit of Israel.
We know that after this exchange, he says:

> Rabbi, You are the Son of God: You are the King of Israel

Nathanael saw a *sign*.
Understanding the Torah, and the teachings of the testaments of God, knowing Jesus' lineage, hearing the reference to the fig tree, it all snapped into place for Nathanael.
But Jesus says:

> Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.

Jesus is asking Nathanael to search his heart.
Certainly mentioning a fig tree isn't enough to cause belief.
Certainly seeing a man isn't enough to cause belief.
You believe because faith.
In spite of Nathanaels initial skepticism, he was ready to place his faith somewhere.

But just wait, Jesus says to Nathanael:

> Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.

You should know, [āˈmēn, or _Truly, truly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen#Hebrew_Bible) is agreement and invoking fulfillment.
Agree with me, says Christ, that you (Nathanael) will see angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man, who Nathanael will come to see as Jesus, the Christ.

Jesus Christ is offered a way out of the law.
From being a true Israelite: a man who knows and follows the law, a man under a fig tree: the fruit of God's good work in Israel, to a man who has had Jesus reveal Himself.
In short, from the [sermon on the mount](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+5&version=NASB);

> Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets: I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.

Philip saw Jesus and thought, _the Law and Prophets spoke about a guy like this_.
He also mentions Jesus' [father Joseph](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+1%3A1-16&version=NASB).
He didn't know it yet, but Philip may have lead the first person to Christ manifest in history.

When we come to Jesus, some of us just know Him as savior, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.
Jesus is the [Son of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_man_(Christianity)#Synoptic_gospels), the fulfillment of the Old Testament through the Law and Prophets.
Jesus said, you've seen Me, but just wait, I will show you who I AM.

---

If you don't know Jesus, if you don't know why you need Him, if you've never learned about salvation, I encourage you to open your Bible.
But don't take my word for anything.

[All of humanity has fallen short of glory](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NASB).
We have all sinned, we all need forgiveness.

The Law cannot save you, it only points out flaws, and shows us we need a savior.
[There is no work that you can do on your own for salvation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8&version=NASB), it is only through Christ.
Only Jesus has fulfilled the Law.

[Jesus Christ is the Word, God, made flesh](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+1%3A1-5&version=NASB).
All of the Bible points to salvation through Jesus Christ alone.
I have prayed for you for salvation if you have not received, and blessings for everyone who has read this article.
